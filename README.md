__employment_success_analyst.py__ calculates various metrics of the success rate for training courses, in terms of the number and percentage of graduates who get relevant jobs. It calculates:
* average time (in days and months) to get a relevant job
* for a given number of months following graduation, the percentage of graduates in relevant employment

## Possible extensions
* refactor the code - there's lots of scope for reusable code
* create classes (student class, cohort class)
* create a master function that covers multiple cohorts
* get user input. Using the terminal, this this might be a bit too much effort for a user, so a web app might be more appropriate.
